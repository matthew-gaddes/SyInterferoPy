    Function to offset the median value of a colormap, and scale the
    remaining color range (i.e. truncate the colormap so that it isn't
    compressed on the shorter side) . Useful for data with a negative minimum and
    positive maximum where you want the middle of the colormap's dynamic
    range to be at zero.
    Input
    -----
      cmap : The matplotlib colormap to be altered
      start : Offset from lowest point in the colormap's range.
          Defaults to 0.0 (no lower ofset). Should be between
          0.0 and 0.5; if your dataset mean is negative you should leave
          this at 0.0, otherwise to (vmax-abs(vmin))/(2*vmax)
      midpoint : The new center of the colormap. Defaults to
          0.5 (no shift). Should be between 0.0 and 1.0; usually the
          optimal value is abs(vmin)/(vmax+abs(vmin))
          Only got this to work with:
              1 - vmin/(vmax + abs(vmin))
      stop : Offset from highets point in the colormap's range.
          Defaults to 1.0 (no upper ofset). Should be between
          0.5 and 1.0; if your dataset mean is positive you should leave
